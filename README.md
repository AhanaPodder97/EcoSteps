## 🌿 About EcoSteps – A Story of Turning Good Intentions Into Daily Action #
Most of us want to live more sustainably — we read tips, follow eco-influencers, feel inspired for a moment and then life gets busy. The intention is there but the habit never sticks.

EcoSteps was born from this gap.
This project began with a simple question:

“Why does sustainable living feel so overwhelming and how can design make it easier?”

As I explored users’ struggles, a clear pattern emerged. People weren’t lacking information — they were lacking guidance. They wanted small wins not big lifestyle overhauls. They wanted encouragement not eco-guilt. And most importantly they wanted a way to see that their actions actually mattered.

That insight became the foundation of EcoSteps, a habit-forming sustainability app designed to turn eco-friendly living into a series of achievable daily micro-actions.

🌱 The Journey

Throughout this UI/UX capstone project, I mapped out the entire experience using the 5S Design Model:

Strategy to define the “why” — helping users move from awareness to action

Scope to identify essential features like micro-habits, challenges and impact tracking

Structure to shape how users progress through habits and rewards

Skeleton to create intuitive wireframes

Surface to bring the app to life with a fresh, nature-inspired visual identity

I spoke to different user types — the conscious beginner, the busy professional, the family-oriented homemaker — and translated their motivations and fears into meaningful design decisions.

🔄 What EcoSteps Helps Users Do

EcoSteps motivates users to adopt sustainable habits through:

Bite-sized daily actions

Streaks, rewards, and achievements

A friendly, non-judgmental tone

Clear visual impact insights

A community that grows with them

Every screen, every flow, and every visual choice supports one core promise:

Sustainable living should feel empowering, not exhausting.

🌍 The Outcome

From research to wireframes to high-fidelity prototypes this project demonstrates how thoughtful design can reshape behavior — not by demanding perfection but by celebrating progress.

EcoSteps tells the story of how sustainability can become second nature one small habit at a time.
